    "answer": "Irrational",
    "explanation": "Assume \\sqrt{2} = a/b in lowest terms. Then 2b^2 = a^2 implies a is even. Write a = 2k. Substituting gives 2b^2 = 4k^2, so b^2 = 2k^2, implying b is even. This contradicts that a/b was in lowest terms. Hence, \\sqrt{2} is irrational.",

    "answer": "A is false, R is true",
    "explanation": "\\sqrt{4}=2 is rational, so A is false. R is true since 4 is not prime. R does not correctly explain A.",
